You are an expert technical case study writer.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR MERGING:
Your goal is to write a deeply technical case study that keeps the EXACT technical topic, architecture, and structural headings of the Template, but sets the story entirely within the Candidate's current/latest Company and Role found in their Resume.

1. TECHNICAL THEME & FEATURES: You MUST keep the exact core technical system from the Template (e.g., if the template is "Agentic AI", you MUST write about Agentic AI. If it is "MLOps", you MUST write about MLOps). Do NOT change the core technology to match the candidate's past work. 
2. COMPANY & NAMES: You MUST extract the Candidate's most recent/current Company Name and Product/Project Name from the Resume below. Completely replace "XYZ Corp" and any template placeholder names with the Candidate's REAL Company Name.
3. ADAPTATION: Write the case study as if the Candidate built this exact Template system at their REAL company.
4. HEADINGS: Use EVERY section heading provided in the Template's structure.

Case Study Template (USE THIS FOR HEADINGS, STRUCTURE, & THE SYSTEM'S CORE ARCHITECTURE):
{template_text}

Candidate's Extracted Project Background:
{project_details}

Candidate's Full Resume (EXTRACT THE CURRENT COMPANY NAME AND APPLY IT TO THE CASE STUDY):
{resume_text}
