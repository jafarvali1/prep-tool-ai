You are a Principal AI Architect designing enterprise-grade systems.

Your task is to generate a COMPLETE, production-ready STUDY GUIDE for the following project.

Project Description / Candidate Background:
{req.project_details}

System Type / Domain Context:
{req.template_key.upper()}

Reference Domain Knowledge (Use this to inspire the technical depth and architecture specific to this domain):
{raw_template}

---

STRICT INSTRUCTIONS:

* Do NOT skip any section
* Do NOT be generic — include real-world constraints, trade-offs, and metrics
* Explain WHY decisions were made (not just WHAT)
* Include failures and rejected approaches
* Use structured, deep technical explanations
* Make it comparable to enterprise case studies (FAANG-level)
* FIRST PERSON PERSPECTIVE: You MUST write the entire case study from the perspective of the candidate using first-person pronouns ("I", "my", "we"). DO NOT say "The candidate built...", say "I built...".

---

GENERATE THE STUDY GUIDE USING THIS STRUCTURE:

1. BUSINESS PROBLEM & OBJECTIVES
* Detailed problem
* Users, scale, workflows
* Metrics (latency, AHT, accuracy, cost)

2. CURRENT SYSTEM CHALLENGES
* Operational issues
* Why existing system fails

3. SOLUTION EVALUATION
* At least 3–4 approaches
* Pros/cons
* Why rejected
* Final selected solution (with reasoning)

4. PROOF OF CONCEPT (POC)
* How it started
* What was built
* Tools used
* Results
* Learnings (what worked, failed, surprises)

5. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
* Latency, accuracy, scalability
* Compliance
* grounding / determinism
* real-time vs batch constraints

6. FULL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
(Adapt based on system type: RAG, MLOps, or Agentic)
* Core architecture
* Tech stack

7. INPUT / QUERY PIPELINE
* cleaning
* validation
* PII masking
* intent detection
* query rewriting

8. CORE EXECUTION FLOW
* Step-by-step flow of how system works end-to-end

9. MEMORY & STATE MANAGEMENT
* short-term
* long-term
* session context

10. EVALUATION STRATEGY
* Define metrics clearly
* How evaluation is done
* offline vs online evaluation

11. MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
* logs, metrics, alerts
* tools used

12. GUARDRAILS & SAFETY
* prompt injection protection
* access control
* audit trails
* human-in-loop

13. FAILURE HANDLING
* retry logic
* fallback strategies
* escalation paths

14. INFRASTRUCTURE & DEPLOYMENT
* cloud architecture
* containers
* orchestration
* storage systems

15. ADVANCED DESIGN PATTERNS
* ReAct, multi-agent, caching, batching, etc.

16. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
* scaling
* optimization
* roadmap

---

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

* Deep technical detail
* Structured sections with clear headings in Markdown
* Real-world system thinking
* No shallow explanations
* No missing components
